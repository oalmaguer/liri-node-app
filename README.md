Liri-node-app

This project was created to practice my skills with node and also javascript conditions. 

It uses different API's to get information, Seatgeek API to see events for artists, Spotify API to check information for the song you want and the OMDB API to get information for any movie you want.

To use the program just run the app with "node liri.js",then write one of this 4 commands.

1st command: "concert-this (insert band name here)" 

Example: node liri.js concert-this Red Hot Chili Peppers 

-----------------------------------------------------------

2nd command: "spotify-this-song (insert song name here)" 

Example: node liri.js spotify-this-song all the small things 

-----------------------------------------------------------

3rd command: "movie-this (insert movie name here)" 

Example: node liri.js movie-this interstellar 

-----------------------------------------------------------

4th command: "do-what-it-says" 

Example: node liri.js do-what-it-says
